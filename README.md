# Chess Clock Application in Java

It has two timers one for each player playing chess. The app also has the feature to give custom times for the play and can also give "increments" for their play. 

The timers were implemented using Android's **Handler**. The timers are accurate to 1/10 of a second. **NumberPickers** were used to get the input play times from users.
